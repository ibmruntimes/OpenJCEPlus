As part of a FIPS 140-3 technology preview capability, this Semeru Runtimes distribution includes a modified OpenSSL 1.1.1 toolkit binary that is currently
undergoing FIPS 140-3 certification testing at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Because this toolkit version was built and
submitted to NIST before we contributed its code to an open source project (now at https://github.com/IBM/OpenCryptographyKitC), the toolkit binary included in
this release contains strings that reference an IBM license. These strings have been removed from the open-source version of the toolkit in addition to other
minor updates.

This notice supersedes the IBM license expressed in the binary itself. The toolkit binary for use with the FIPS 140-3 technology preview capability license
terms are found in https://github.com/IBM/OpenCryptographyKitC/blob/main/LICENSE.
